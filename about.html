    <h2>The Need</h2>
    <p>
      In many parts of our country, children lack access to basic education, women are denied opportunities to grow, and youth remain unemployed due to lack of skills. Udan Foundation was created to fill these critical gaps. We believe every human deserves a chance to rise, regardless of their background or circumstance.
